# THE DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT ALL THE FILES CONTAIN ARE CONTAINED IN THIS FILE
Combined Feature engineering and Shallow Network engineering contains the notebook in which the custom model was developed and trained and tested on a DEAP based dataset collected from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-feeling-emotions
<br/>
av_conv, a_conv, av_pca, a_pca contain separate EEG 2 channel electrode signal data for audio-visual (av) and only audio (a) stimuli combined to 1D signal using Principal component analysis or Convolution Respectively.
<br/>
emotions.csv contains the dataset on which the main model has been trained and tested.
<br/>
haee_model.keras contains the custom model keras file.
<br/>
Both SVG format files are diagrams showing the structure of the custom model.
<br/>
Implementation of custom model on custom feature extraction pipeline notebook (ipynb) contains an implementation of the model for the raw EEG files focussing on feature extraction and testing on a different dataset as compared to training dataset.
