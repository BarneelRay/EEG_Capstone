<br/>
av_conv, a_conv, av_pca, a_pca contain separate EEG 2 channel electrode signal data for audio-visual (av) and only audio (a) stimuli combined to 1D signal using Principal component analysis or Convolution Respectively.
<br/>
emotions.csv contains the dataset on which the main model has been trained and tested.
